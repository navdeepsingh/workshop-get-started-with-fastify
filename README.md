# Workshop: Get Started with Fastify

> Learn the basics of building an API with the [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) Node.js framework.

This workshop was created by Simon Plenderleith ([@simonplend](https://twitter.com/simonplend)).

## Requirements

- Node.js >= v14.13.0 ([how to install](https://nodejs.dev/learn/how-to-install-nodejs))

To verify that you have the software installed that you need for this workshop,
you can run this command in your terminal:

```bash
node --version
```

## Setup

> If you want to commit and push your work to your own repository on GitHub,
> you will need to [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
> this repository, then clone your fork rather than this repository directly.

To prepare for the workshop, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/simonplend/workshop-get-started-with-fastify.git

cd workshop-get-started-with-fastify

npm install
```

This will install the dependencies for the `starter` and `completed` applications.

`cd` into the `starter` directory in your terminal and follow the instructions
in the [starter application README](./starter/README.md).
